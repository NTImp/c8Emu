# c8EMU #
c8EMU is nothing but a simple chip8 emulator made for fun.
### Build ###
You have to install SDL2 and gcc before compiling the project.
```
make
```
### Run ###
Remember that this is just an emulator, you have to get some rom to use it.
```
./c8EMU [your_rom_path]
```
If the rom does not exists or is an invalid one the emulator will have an unexpected behavior.
